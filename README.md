# rat
I did not aim to create a full replacement that surpasses the original. I was simply curious(rat is approx. 14 times slower than `cat`). 

It's also doesn't "copy" original source code, when I looked over it I thought I was in programming hell ;_;

## Why?
For fun, i wanted to practice

## Known Shit
Passing a file contents via stdin, e.g 
```bash
rat file.txt | rat -
```
will multiple lines, idk how to fix this now and i don't have time for it
